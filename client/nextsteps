- styling for bug dashboard admin and reference this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYxLwn-Kk2U&t=6s

style comments again with comment entire info

api
- how can i refactor api to make one huge api call instead of tiny ones
user developer dashboard
- when a user is remvoed from a project the user has to be updated in redux and also when the user is added to a project

developers (potentially can not edit bugs either??)
- when developer is done with bug they should be able to remove themselves from it
- when developer does not have project they should be able to request to join one or join a public project that does not require permission

Viewer should be able to request to become a developer

Admin should be able to make people admins as well 

when tables get a certain width i want to make the tables 
display vertically instead of horizontally

screen recording function to show how to create bug

add validation for project and bug titles

***Styling***
styling and ui!!
Dark/light mode
fix navbar when screen is a certain size
popups when api requests are correctly handled
project and bug dates are incorrect
website layout
project timeline/dashboard layout

***User authentication/authorization***
add user roles and capabilities
request user roles for users
add delete user after they have been inactive for 2 weeks
edit user info on user page
filter based on user auth that only shows what needs to be shown to given user, developers should only see projects they are assigned to, admin should see all, 
ban from adding comments if they put something they are not suppose to
uncomment protected routes in app.js

***aggregate api call***??
